## Course description

This year's seminar "Advanced Topics in Psycholinguistics" will focus on **experimental pragmatics**. The field of experimental pragmatics combines an interest in the theoretical complexities of language use with the experimental methodologies of psycholinguistics. The course will present a broad survey of recent work in this area that has attempted to apply the methods of experimental psychology to classic issues in theoretical pragmatics. Each class session will include both theoretical and experimental readings on topics such as reference, implicature, and presupposition. The course will be organized primarily around discussion of the assigned readings. Students will develop a research proposal relevant to issues in language use. May be repeated for credit.

## Goals and assessment

To familiarize themselves with the debates in the recently emerging field of experimental pragmatics, students will read and present relevant papers. Students taking the course for two units are expected to read, present, and participate. Students taking the course for four units are additionally expected to submit an original research project proposal that includes a literature overview.

## Schedule

The course will meet Tuesdays from 3-5:50pm in Room 240-201.
